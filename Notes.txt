- Mounting
  - When an instance of a component is created and inserted into the DOM.
  - constructor
  - static getDerivedStateFromProps
  - render
  - componentDidMount

- Updating
  - When a component is being rerendered as a result of changes to either its props or state.
  - static getDerivedStateFromProps
  - shouldComponentUpdate
  - render
  - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
  - componentDidUpdate

- Unmounting
  - When a component is being removed from the DOM.
  - componentWillUnmount

- Error Handling
  - When there is an error during rerendering in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor or in any child component.
  - static getDerivedStateFromError
  - componentDidCatch

- Methods in detail
  - constructor(props)
    - A special function that will get called whenever a new component is created.
    - DOs
      - Initialize state
      - Bind event handlers
    - DON'Ts
      - Make http requests
    - Note
      - Call super(props)
      - Overwrite state

  - static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
    - This method is called everytime when a component rerenders
    - DOs
      - Set the state
    - DON'Ts
      - Make http requests

  - render()
    - Required method
    - DOs
      - Based on props and state, return jsx.
    - DON'Ts
      - Change state, change DOM element, make http calls.
    - Note
      - After render method, children component's render method is also called.

  - componentDidMount()
    - This method is called only once in entire lifecycle. This method is called immediately after component and all its children components are rendered.
    - DOs
      - Interact with DOM
      - Make http calls

  - shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
    - Dictates if the component should rerender or not.
    - DOs
      - Performance Optimization (by not rerendering the component)
    - DON'Ts
      - Make http calls
      - call setState method

  - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
    - Called before the changes in virtual DOM are reflcated in the DOM
    - DOs
      - Capture information from the DOM

  - componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
    - This method is called when render is finished in rerender cycles
    - DOs
      - Make http calls

  - componentWillUnmount()
    - Method is called right brfore a component is unmounted and destroyed
    - DOs
      - Cancel network requests
      - Remove eventhandlers
      - Cancel subscriptions
      - Invalidate timers
    - DON'Ts
      - Call setState method

- Fragments
  - Used to contain multiple elements, without adding new elements to the DOM.

- PureComponents
  - Pure components rerenders only if there is a change in state when setState is changed.
  - shouldComponentUpdate returns true always in regular component but in pure component, it does shallow state and props comparision and based on that it returns true or false.

- Memo
  - PureComponent is for class based components, for functional components, there is memo.

- Ref
  - To get reference of a DOM element.

- Portals
  - Used to mount element on different DOM element (than id=root)

- Higher Order Components
  - Used to enhance components

- Render props
  - Technique to share functionalities and values among components

- Context
